# Numerical solution to time dependent harmonic oscillator

This is my final year project at the University of Nottingham. In this project, I used different algorithms to solve the Schrodinger equation with a time-dependent potential in MATLAB, and thus simualate particle creation under a time-dependent potential. After that I compared the theoretical values and the numerical values to conduct error analysis and analyse the stability of the algorithms used.
